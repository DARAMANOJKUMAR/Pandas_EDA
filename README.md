Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Pandas

Understanding the Task:
Performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Steps Performed:

1.Loading the Dataset:
Imported the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv() or similar functions.

2.Initial Inspection:
Used methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand the structure, data types, and summary statistics.

3.Data Visualization:
Created visualizations to uncover patterns and trends:
Histograms to analyze the distribution of numerical columns.
Boxplots to detect outliers in key variables.
Scatterplots for relationships between two variables.

4.Correlation Analysis:
Used df.corr() to calculate correlations between numerical features.
Visualized correlations using a heatmap with seaborn.

5.Grouping and Aggregation:
Used .groupby() to summarize data by categories (e.g., mean sales by region).

6.Insights:
Highlighted key findings, such as significant correlations, dominant trends, and anomalies.

7.Outcome:
Generated actionable insights and a better understanding of the dataset for further decision-making.
